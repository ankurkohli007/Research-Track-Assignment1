# Research-Track-Assignment 1
### ABSTRACT

The assignment is based on Pyhton language. Python laguage is an interpreted high-level programming language which is also a general purporsoe programming approach. In this assignment, code is designed to drive an autonomous robot in a given path. A robot is equiped with sensors which can detect boxes around all directions. When robot driving is initiated then robot needs to detect the silver and gold boxes. As the silver box detected in the robot driving path than robot grab that box and place that box to clear it's moving lane and move ahead. If there will be any golden box or boxes detected in the robot moving path than it avoids those box or boxes and find the clear lane to complete journey. In this code there some functions used such as R. see (), R. grab (), R. release (), and so on to perform different functions.
